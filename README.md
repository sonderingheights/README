# hello world

<p>
  Hi there! I'm <a href="https://bysusanlin.com">Susan</a>, Product Designer + Artist. You might know me as the Founder of  <a href="https://mintlodica.com">Mintlodica</a>, the mechanical keyboards brand. In my past, I built design systems & led design teams. In my early Web 1.0 days, I ran a Neopets guild and built a Geocities site using an <code><iframe></code> layout. This was the beginning of my love for the web.
